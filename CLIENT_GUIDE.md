# Client Guide: Hazel Bites QuickOrder System

Welcome to the **Hazel Bites QuickOrder** system! This digital ordering platform is designed to streamline your restaurant operations, from table-side ordering to kitchen management.

This guide will help you understand how to navigate and use the various components of the application.

## 1. System Overview

The QuickOrder system consists of three main interfaces:
*   **Customer Table View**: Where guests browse the menu and place orders.
*   **Kitchen Display System (KDS)**: Where kitchen staff view and manage incoming orders.
*   **Admin Dashboard**: Where management can update the menu, view analytics, and configure restaurant settings.

## 2. Accessing the Application

### For Customers (QR Code / Table View)
Each table has a unique URL (which would be linked to a QR code).
*   **Format**: `http://<your-domain>/restaurant/<restaurant-id>/table/<table-number>`
*   **Example (Table 5)**: `http://localhost:3000/restaurant/1/table/5`

### For Kitchen Staff
*   **Kitchen Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/kitchen`
    *   This screen should be displayed on a tablet or monitor in the kitchen.
    *   Orders appear here in real-time as they are placed by customers.

### For Administrators
*   **Menu Management**: `http://localhost:3000/admin/menu`
*   **Settings**: `http://localhost:3000/admin/settings`

## 3. Using the Customer Interface

Guests can:
*   **Browse Categories**: Filter items by selecting categories like "Burgers", "Egyptian Classics", etc.
*   **View Item Details**: Click on an item to see its description, price, and customize options (e.g., adding extra toppings).
*   **Add to Cart**: Add items to their basket.
*   **Place Order**: Review their cart and confirm the order. The order is immediately sent to the kitchen.
*   **Call Waiter**: (If enabled) Use the "Call Waiter" feature to request assistance.

## 4. Kitchen Display System (KDS)

The KDS is the heartbeat of your kitchen operations.
*   **New Orders**: Appear automatically with a "Pending" status.
*   **Preparation**: Staff can tap an order to mark it as "In Progress" or individual items as "Done".
*   **Completion**: Once all items are ready, the order can be marked as "Ready" or "Served".
*   **Visual Cues**: Orders may change color based on how long they have been waiting (e.g., turning red if delayed).

## 5. Admin & Menu Management

Keep your menu fresh and up-to-date.
*   **Add/Edit Items**: Go to the Menu page to add new dishes, update prices, or change descriptions.
*   **Stock Management**: Mark items as "Out of Stock" to instantly hide them from the customer view.
*   **Categories**: Organize your menu into intuitive sections.

## 6. Troubleshooting & Support
